I thoroughly enjoyed living and working there. It is incredibly rare to get a post at a school like Kearsney for your first position, my only grievance was that there was very little room to grow beyond Head of Department. I would have happily stayed there for decades but my wife and I decided that our futures lay in Sydney and it was time for a new adventure.

During my time there I was a research assistant in the genetics lab. I mainly worked in phylogenetics and did my own research on the side to potentially form a masters degree. Before I could finish I was offered an incredible opportunity at Kearsney College which I grabbed with both hands.

                            After working in science for two years and education for two years I have decided to change my career path towards technology and web development.

Immediately after moving to Sydney I began studying at coder academy, it has been an incredible introduction to web development and a great first step into the industry.

                                            Rhodes university is located in Grahamstown, South Africa. The vast majority of my tertiary education was undertaken in the science faculty at Rhodes. I was fortunate enough to be in a position to triple major and have a few minors as well. The majority of my studies were directed at biological sciences but I initially went to Rhodes to study information systems.
